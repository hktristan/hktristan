## Welcome to my Github Page 👋
My name is Tristan Wilson (he/him). I am currently a full stack engineer based in the United States.

This is a place where I learn and realize any ideas I have into the digital world.

### Languages and Frameworks 🧠
For work, I mostly use C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PostgreSQL. I have also done projects using React and Typescript as well.

I do also have some knowledge of C, C++, and Java from my university days but it would require some review to regain any proficiency.

I would like to learn languages like Python, Go, and Rust which is what this Github is for!

### Fun Facts About Me ☺️
- Some hobbies of mine include playing video games, practicing martial arts, and reading.
- I don't regularly drink coffee or tea (although I do enjoy the occasional matcha).
- Much like most things in the US, I was also made in China.
